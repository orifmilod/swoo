# Roo-Xcode

Roo-Xcode is an Xcode extension conceptually inspired by the Roo-Code VSCode extension. This project provides a foundation for building Xcode extensions in Swift, with a structure mirroring the original Roo-Code project.

## Structure

- `Roo-Xcode.xcodeproj/` — Xcode project file (placeholder, create with Xcode)
- `RooXcodeExtension/` — Main extension target
  - `Info.plist` — Extension configuration (placeholder)
  - `Sources/` — Swift source files
  - `Assets.xcassets/` — Asset catalog (placeholder)
  - `en.lproj/Localizable.strings` — English localization (placeholder)
- `Tests/` — Unit tests for the extension
- `README.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, `LICENSE`, `.gitignore` — Project documentation and config

## Getting Started

1. Open `Roo-Xcode.xcodeproj` in Xcode (create the project file if it does not exist).
2. Add your Swift source files to `RooXcodeExtension/Sources/`.
3. Add assets and localizations as needed.
4. Implement your Xcode extension logic in Swift.
